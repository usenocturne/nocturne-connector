Welcome to Nocturne Connector OS!

If you are trying to set up the Connector, please refer
to the GitHub: https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-connector

If you are experienced and you want to change something, you may
remount the rootfs as read-write with: mount -o remount,rw /

You can set the active boot slot using the ab_active utility,
or flash an image to the inactive slot using the ab_flash utility.
